<p>This graph is intended to show Australian residents and compare energy consumption each year in order to maintain
sustainability, particularly in the industry sector, <br>which includes the government sectors and electricity companies,
environmentalists, and global citizen. <br> According to the data, we have found out energy consumption in New south Wales And Victoria has always been higher than other states
during the last two decades in Transportation and electricity industry. <br> Following Queensland and Western Australia is the third and fourth largest energy consumption. <br>Furthermore, we also discovered that Tasmania and Northern Territory had the lowest energy consumption in Australia. Following the South Australia is the third lowest in energy consumption.</p>
